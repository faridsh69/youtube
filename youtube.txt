	https://youtu.be/8qIZQ9zSAwk

	initial:
		1 git init
		2 git remove add origin "github/gitlab repo url"
		3 git add .
		4 git commit -m "your message what you have done in this commit"
		5 git push origin master

	feature-branch
		1 git checkout development
		2 git fetch
		3 git pull origin development
		4 git checkout -b "#001-create-migration-user-in-database"
		5 git add .
		6 git commit -m "001-create-migration-user-in-database: added new migration"
		7 git push origin 001-create-migration-user-in-database
		8 create a pull request (merge request) and assign your manager as reviewer
		9 merge it
		10 git checkout development, fetch, pull 

	solve conflicts (when deploying feature branch to master)
		1 git checkout branch b2 => git pull
		2 git pull origin development
		2 you will face conflicts and see HEAD ======= > commit id in your code
		3 git checkout --ours . (if you want to accept what ever you wrote to be pushed)
		OR 4 git checkout --theirs . (if you want to accept what ever in master branch is)
		5 git add .
		6 git commit -m "solved conflicts accepted ours"
		7 git push origin b2

	solve conflicts (when deploying fully develop branch to staging)
		- Deploy develop to staging:
		1 git fetch
		2 git checkout develop
		3 git pull
		4 git checkout staging
		5 git pull
		6 git checkout -b dev-to-staging-2026-01-23 (create this middle branch from staging, increase its verion)
		7 git merge develop
			(solve conflicts by these commands to accept current changes from develop)
		8 git checkout --ours . (OR git restore --source=HEAD --ours .) (these are same)
		9 git add .
		10 git commit
		11 git push origin dev-to-staging-2026-01-23
		12 Create PR From dev-to-staging-2026-01-23 to staging
			(DO NOT MERGE IT TO DEVELOP, we need it only merged to staging)
		13 create PR From develop to staging (Or use the current one you already created before start merging)
